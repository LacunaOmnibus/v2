NOTES FOR DEPLOYMENT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INSTRUCTIONS: 

File a note in here any time a change is made to a mission that will require something 
special to be done on the server before/after deployment. There are currently three
circumstances in which that can happen:

1) If you rename a mission file.

2) If you delete a mission file.

3) If you change the fleet movement paramters of an objective. 

NOTE: You should attempt to avoid all of these circumstances if you can help it.

Here are some example notes:

2010-11-28: Changed mission parameters for 'send-a-ship-over-here.mission'.
2010-12-03: Deleted 'some-mission-file.mission'.
