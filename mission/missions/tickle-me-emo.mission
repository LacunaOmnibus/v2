   "description" : "Claude Downer, the Venetian performance artist known to some as Sadness Sorrow Wo, has undertaken a new project which he hopes will go better than his last major work, a 328-volume epic poem about how misunderstood he is and how his jeans are too tight.  This time around, he's hoping to bring down the mood of an entire world.  He's prepared a set of advertisements highlighting horrible diseases, romantic liaisons gone sour, and puppy-kicking.  Will you allow him to use your world for his project?  If you will, he'll provide some milk for your citizens to enjoy while weeping.",
