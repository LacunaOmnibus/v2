Come and get me, if you can.\nOr, you can help me.  I'm planning the greatest heist of all time and I need your help to pull it off.  Without giving away any details, I can say it involves an illusion the likes of which has never been seen.  To pull off that many hologram units at once, I'll need nearly a planet's supply of energy, fledgling planet though you may be.  If you can get me 40,000 power with no more questions asked, I'll give you Daloris, my first smuggling ship.  What do you say?",
