You see, the Isilli Church in the next system over has arranged their entire worship system around a single glorious Rutile glyph.  This compels us to action!  As our prophet Uruman said in the 33rd decree, \"Thou shalt covet thy neighbor's possessions.\"  Therefore, we seek a pure, glittering Gold glyph, to do them one better.  Ha-ha!  I'd like to see the look on the Arch-deacon's face when we complete this place of worship.  Anyway.  We can offer you some Energy in exchange.  Have we a deal, infidel?",
