We're researching the wide variety of foods available to other sentients and are highly interested in obtaining samples of foods from throughout the Expanse.  In short, we'd like samples of such exotic foods as Apples, Corn, Wheat, and Milk.  If you can provide us with 2500 of each of these foods, we'll happily provide you with free upgrades to your Orchard for levels 6-8.",
