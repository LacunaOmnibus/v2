   "description" : "Greetings fellow governor,\n\nUnfortunately, we have run aground of a new issue. The cargo ships from the Homeworld are notoriously slow and we have run out of our supplies of festive foods. All we have left is fungus and algae. As you know, the people can become very restless with only this tasteless fare.\n\nMy people are on the verge of riot. I beseech you to send burgers and chips in large quantity (at least 5k of each) to hold us over until the Homeworld ships arrive. I promise the Expanse will hear about your generosity. As I know that is not enough, I will offer our technology in our areas of Fission Power.",
